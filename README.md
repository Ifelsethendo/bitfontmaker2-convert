# bitfontmaker2-convert

- `bitfontmaker2-to-a21.py` is a simple script converting bitmap fonts from JSON outputted by [BitFontMaker2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/) into C++ code compatible with `Font8` class of `a21` library.

- `PixelstadTweaked.json` is a tweaked version of the public domain 8-bit font called
	[Pixelstad](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/?id=1482) from the Gallery of BitFontMaker 2. 
	This font looks good as a "console" font for a Nokia LCD display I use in little embedded projects.

Other public domain fonts in this repo exported from the Gallery (their actual look on the LCD was not tested):

- `ATARISTOCRAT.json`
- `BetterPixels.json`
- `BitmapMiddleFont.json`
- `BitmapSmallFont.json`
